CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT TOOL ex, chef, puppet, salt, ansible

	->Agentless, use SSH connections
	->parallel execution of script in all servers
	->ansible (native code) script is called PLAYBOOK
	->helps in 
		configuration management
		Application deployment
		Task Automation
		Infra orchestration

* ARCHITECTURE
	
	ansible			ansible.cfg			playbooks	ansible
	inventory			.								.		clients
		.						.								.		server 1	
		.						.								.		server 2
		....ansible master/collector/...............	server 3
				engine

	-> Ipaddress or (FQDN) of the client server will be configured in the inventory file.
	-> ansible.cfg file have the location of the inventory file
	-> PLAYBOOKS having the cmd to execute in the client servers
	-> connection to client from master will be by SSH connections

* INSTALLATION

	-> python3 is must on the ansible controller engine and client nodes.
	-> windows can be ansible client, but windows cannot be ansible controller
	-> 3 ways to install
			using package manager
			using python pip
			using compile file

  * using python pip
		can install the specific version of ansible.
		can install multiple version of ansible in same controller machine
		
	python --> multileple Virtual Env --> different ansible version
	
	      sudo apt update
		  sudo apt install python3
		  sudo apt install python3-pip
		  python3 --version
	
	Dependencies:-
			sudo apt install python3-minimal python3-virtualenv python3-dev build-essential
	
	VirtualEnv Setup:-
			mkdir ansible
			cd ansible
			python3 -m venv myansible <any name>
	
	Activate Venv:-
			source myansible/bin/activate
	
	To deactivate Venv:-
			deactivate
	
	Install Ansible:-
			pip3 intall -U ansible
			ansible --version
	
	*Config
		-> we can use ansible.cfg from /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg (or)
		-> create ansible.cfg in anyplace and add environment variable by
			export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/var/ansible/ansible.cfg
		-> echo $ANSIBLE_CONFIG
	* To remove env-var
		unset ANSIBLE_CONFIG
		
		-> After creating ansible.cfg, need to create hosts and add inventory path to the config file.
				syntax for ansible.cfg file..
					[defaults]
					inventory = hosts
	* Ansible Automation
			Ansible engine use SSH connection to connect to clients
				#using username and password
				#using SSH keys
		
		sample test to verify connection		
			
			cmd = ansible all -m ping
	
*DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
	
	How to create different environment in the ansible hostsfile.?
		-Create 'inventory' directory
		-Create environment inside the directory.
		-mention the path of the hosts file inside the ansible.cfg file #hosts file name can be anything.
		-add the ip or domain to the hosts file and check.
		
		ex:- in ansible.cfg --> inventory = /home/sys-admin/Pictures/ansible/inventory/dev_hosts

	* Inventory file with groups.
		-> we can define the group in [].
			ex:-
				[all]
				192.168.2.78
				192.168.2.83
				
				[webserver]
				192.168.2.80
				192.168.2.81
				
			cmd = ansible all:webserver -m ping
			
*ANSIBLE AUTOMATION

 to connect to cloud instance client, AWS -> key pairs -> import key pair. copy pub key or browse file.
	->AD-HOC 
	->PLAYBOOKS
	
	*Ad-Hoc
		one liner cmd which perform one task on ansible clients
	syntax-
		ansible [group] -m shell -a [cmd]
		
	ex:-
		cmd = ansible webserver -m shell -a "apt update"
		cmd = ansible webserver -m shell -a "uptime"
		
 	-> to view all modules in ansible.
		
		cmd = ansible-doc -l
		cmd = ansible-doc -l >> ansible.txt = export to txt file
		
	 * Playbooks.
	 	executing series of cmds.
	
	 * Transfer files from engine to clients.
	 	syntax-
			ansible [group] -m copy -a [src=source_path dest=destination_path]
		
		cmd = ansible webserver -m copy -a "src=/home/sys-admin/Desktop/temp.txt dest=/tmp"
	
	-> copy content as a new file.
		
		cmd = ansible webserver -m copy -a "content= this is my file dest=/tmp/temp.txt"
		
	*Files and folder management.
		->user can create file or directory on ansible client from ansible controller.
		syntax-
			ansible webserver -m file   -a "path=file/dir destination state=<state>"
		
		createfile-
			ansible webserver -m file -a "path=file/dir destination state=touch"
		Delete file-
			ansible webserver -m file -a "path=file/dir destination state=absent"
			
			cmd = ansible webserver -m file -a "dest=/home/sys-admin/Desktop/test.txt state=touch mode=0775"
			
			cmd = ansible webserver -m file -a "dest=/home/sys-admin/Desktop/folder state=directory"
	
	*Install packages.
		-> can install/uninstall using package manager on ansible clients.
		
		syntax-
			ansible [group] -m yum/apt -a "name=<package-name> state=<state>"
			cmd = ansible webserver -m shell -a "sudo yum list installed | grep nginx"

to install package	cmd = ansible webserver -m yum -a "name=nginx state=present"
			
		-> how to pass the root access to cmd
			
					cmd = ansible webserver -m yum -a "name=git state=present" -b
to update package	cmd	= ansible webserver -m yum -a "name=git state=latest" -b
	
state=
	present - will install the package
	absent - will uninstall the package.
	latest - will update the package to latest version
	etc..
	
*ANSIBLE MODULES, VARIABLES AND FACTS.
	
	*Modules.
		*SetUp module-
			#used to get facts while executing playbooks
	*Facts-
		1.Default fact
		2. Custom fact
		
	*Custom Facts,
		>used to get extra information about managed nodes
		>if custom facts are on managed nodes, then custom facts are called default.
		> it helps to reduce the code lines in playbook.
		>helps to build env specific configuation.
		steps to create,
		
			#create .fact formatted file in /etc/ansible/facts.d on managed nodes (ie. client nodes)
			#output of fact file should be JSON and fact file should have execution permission.
			
*INVENTORIES
	Types:-
		*Static Inventory
		*Dynamic inventory.
		
		*Dynamic Inventory
			> script like shell/python
			> preferable over static inventory
			
		*dynamic inventory creation
			>ansible have dynamic inventory script for all the clouds.
			>we can use plugins.
				
				#list plugins.
				
				cmd = ansible-doc -t inventory -l
				
				#Add enable plugins syntax in ansible cfg file
					ex:
						[inventory]
						enable_plugins=host_list,script,auto,yaml,ini,toml 
			
			#to configure aws inventory we need boto3 and botocore
			cmd = sudo pip3 install boto3
			cmd = sudo pip3 install boto
	
	-> Add aws credentials to ansible by exporting as a env variable.
		cmd = export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='key'
		cmd = export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='key'
	
	IAM user -> Add user -> username -> access key/password -> group (administrator) -> create.
	
	-> create YML file for aws plugin.
		plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2
		
	-> aws dynamic inventory.
		ansible-inventory -i <plugin name> --graph
	
*PLAYBOOKS
	->To execute multiple configuration.
	->YAML format.
	->useful for multiple things like configuration management, 
		
		Sample Playbook:-
		
									---
										- name: Playbook
										  hosts: all
										  become: yes
										  become_user: root
										  tasks:
											- name: ensure apache is at the latest version
											  yum:
												name: httpd
												state: latest
												
												-> ask password
										ansible-playbook playbook.yml -K
(or)

ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-become-pass

	 cmd = ansible-playbook -i inventory -u user playbookname.yml
	 
	 
	 ---
		  - name: playbook
			 hosts: all
			 remote_user: ec2-user
			 become: yes
			 become_user: root
			 
				tasks:
					- name: install apache
						yum:
							name: httpd
							state: present
							
	cmd = ansible-playbook  playbookname.yml
	
	  -> we can check the syntax of the yml file by the below cmd.
	  
	  cmd= ansible-playbook -i inventory -u user ansible-playbook.yml --syntax-check
	  
	  -> to run the playbook in dry run mode (dry run - just to execute the playbook and check results without affecting the target machine)
	  
	  cmd = ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
	  
	  -> to check in verbose mode
	  
	  cmd = ansible-playbook playbook.yml -v (-vvvvvv = multiple v's for more detailed verbose)
	  
*DEBUG_MODULE

	-> if we want to print a msg when executing the task,
	
	sample playbook:-
	
									- name: playbook
										hosts: all
										remote_user: sys-admin
										become: yes
										become_user: root
										
										tasks:
											- name: debug
												debug:
												msg: "hi, this is custom msg for the debug module"
												
											- name: debug
												debug:
												msg:
												- " hi this is multi-line msg"
												- " this is 2nd line of msg"
												
											- name: variable msg pring
												debug:
												msg: "host IP is - {{ inventory_hostname}}"
					
		* Variables in playbook
		
												var:
													test: this is my file
												- name: debug
													debug:
													msg: test
				
		* Data collection
		
			-> is used to store multiple values.
										var:
											cities:
												- madurai
												- chennai
												- covai
												- Tanjore
											webserver: { 'apache', 'nginx', 'httpd'}
											
										- name: anything
											debug:
												msg: cities
												
										- name: anything
											debug:
												msg: webserver
